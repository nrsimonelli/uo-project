# UO Project

UO Project is a web-based **auto-battler tournament system** inspired by _Unicorn Overlord_.  
It combines tactical depth, automated battles, and community-driven events into one platform.

---

## 🌟 What It Is

- A place to **build and customize teams** of units with unique classes, skills, and formations.
- A system for **automated battles** where strategy and preparation matter more than quick reflexes.
- A platform for **competitive and experimental play**, supporting both structured tournaments and casual mock battles.

---

## 🎯 Why It Exists

- To capture the excitement of tactical RPG combat in a **hands-off, spectator-friendly format**.
- To provide a **competitive environment** where strategy and team-building shine.
- To create a foundation for new players and experienced _Unicorn Overlord_ fans alike to share, enjoy, and build upon.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Units** — The characters that make up a team. Each unit has stats, classes, traits, and abilities.
- **Teams** — Squads of one to five units arranged in a 2x3 grid formation.
- **Skills** — Active and passive abilities that drive combat. Skills may deal damage, heal, or apply buff/debuffs.
- **Tactics** — Rules that influence both how and when skills are applied.
- **Battles** — Fully automated combat resolved by initiative order actions, skills, and RNG that is both deterministic and repeatable.
- **Replays** — Logs of every action taken in a battle, allowing matches to be reviewed or shared later on.
